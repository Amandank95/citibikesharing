The purpose of this analysis is to assist in bringing CitiBike to Des Moines.

When taking a look at the Trips by weekday per hour chart, you will notice a lot of users will ride during the hours of 5pm-7pm. This could potentially be for after work or school use. 

![checkouttime](bike_utilization.png)
The total checkout time per ride is farily short. Equally more important though, is to note exactly how many rides those are. There are a total of 145,752 rides with a total of a 6 minute ride time.

![subscriber](subscribers.png)
Another good point I would like to note is how many riders are actually subscribed to the service. There are close to 2 million subscribers as opposed to just customers where there are only about 443,000. With such a high subscribtion rate, you could guess that these are regular daily riders.
